# SQL Cleaning Data Project

In this project you receive an excel file with information that needs to be cleaned (data with errors, NULL, duplicates, etc).

Through the use of SQL, the data is cleaned so that later it can be processed correctly.

The objective is to take a list of property sales and clean up the information using SQL code.
